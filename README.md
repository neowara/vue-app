# **TVMaze Vue App**
This project was built using Vue 2.6 and TypeScript 4.5 in ~8 hours
Uses [TVMaze](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) as API

### If I had more time this is what I would do:

* I would add a component to render stars as images inside a div depending on the Score of a TV show or movie.
* I would make it so all the pictures in the result align properly (since all pictures are not the same size there needs to be a workaround for this)
* I would create a filter for the Search component, so that the user can search with different filters such as 'year', 'genre', 'release year', etc.
* I would give the user feedback if there are no results found in the API call or if their connection is slow
* I would give search movie or show suggestions as the user types in the search bar
* I would add the possibility to search for an actor/actress & display their data (like movies, age, etc.)
* I would allow the user to click on Cast details in ShowDetails.vue to take them to a detailed actor/actress page
